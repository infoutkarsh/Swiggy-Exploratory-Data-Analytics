# Description

The basic idea of analyzing the Swiggy dataset is to get a fair idea about the popularity of restraunts based on ratings and widely available cuisines among all the restaurants of vadodara. 

To start the analysis, data was extracted from the Swiggy website using a provided URL. Specifically, the names and ratings of restaurants that were visible on the front page of the website were collected and recorded in a CSV file. This allowed for easy organization and retrieval of the data at a later time.

After collecting this initial data, the next step was to scrape data for each individual restaurant. This involved reading the recorded data for all restaurants and categories, and then using this information to extract data for each restaurant on its own.

By analyzing this data, it is possible to gain insights into the popularity of different restaurants based on their ratings, as well as the types of cuisine that are most widely available among all of the restaurants. This information can be useful for individuals looking to find the best restaurants in the area, as well as for businesses and entrepreneurs looking to start their own restaurants or food-related ventures.
The recorded data for all restaurants and categories was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually.
